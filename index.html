    &quot;Grave House&quot; is a 12 track mixtape and is the first release of Sematary's discography. It is most notable for its grungy and washed out trap beats, deadpan vocals, esoteric lyricism, and its use of samples from black metal songs. This mixtape features verses on every song from co-rapper, GHOST MOUNTAIN, providing his own unique voice and lyrics.

    &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; is an 11 track mixtape and is the second release of Sematary's Discography. It is most notable as Sematary's first mixtape to make an impact in the underground rap scene. This was in no small part from the iconic cover art. A bizarrely stretched photo of Sematary in his titular outfit of all black True Religion attire with New Rock boots is edited onto a surreal, liminal, bright green and blue landscape with a rainbow over a bridge. Sematary wished his dogs to be immortalized with this album hence the crudely pasted dogs on each side. Lila the black dog(left) passed away in October of 2024. Combining this with the oversaturated colors and deep fried filter over everything comes together to create a truly eye catching and potentially humorous album cover. As for the music, there is noticibly more focus in sound mixing, sample use, and vocal delivery. Several of Sematary's most famous songs are on this mixtape such as &quot;Slaughter House&quot; and &quot;Bunny Suit&quot;.

    &quot;Warboy&quot; is a 6 track EP and is the third release of Sematary's discography. Easily the most underrated, dirtiest, grimiest sounding project he has produced. It is most notable for it's extremely washed out trap beats, hard black metal samples, and bizarre subject matter within the lyrics. The creation of the mixtape happened knee deep in the quarantine of 2020 and Sematary has reflected on this time negatively. In an interview with Masked Gorilla, he mentions a film class

    &quot;Rainbow Bridge 2&quot; is a 14 track mixtape that serves as the second installment of the Rainbow Bridge triology and is the fourth release of Sematary's discography. While RB1 has a brighter cleaner sound than the grimey Warboy, Sematary takes the sounds of these two mixtapes and reaches an interesting middle ground. This mixtape tends to be the most divisive among fans of Sematary with the strange mixing and two extremely bizarre sounding features from Juju and Slug Christ.

    &quot;Hundred Acre Wrist&quot; is a 10 track mixtape and is the fifth release of Sematary discography. It is widely regarded as the best mixtape produced by Sematary. Like Grave House, it is another collaborative project with Ghost Mountain with a verse from him every song. The mixtape is very well mixed with a booming bass, clean sounding drums and high hats, guitar(played by Sematary himself), and atmosphereic synths that provides a mystical and dreamy quality to the tape. The theme of the tape itself is derived from the Hundred Acre Woods inhabited by Winnie the Pooh and his friends. Sematary and Ghost Mountain dwell within Cleaver Valley where they sacrifice cops and nazis to the all powerful Deer God whom they worship. All in all, this tape is Sematary at its tightest and most solid conceptually. With clear direction, theme, and good sounding music contributing to this being regarded as the best Sematary tape.

    Anyone who truly believes they love music in all of its forms must listen to this. This is the kind of project that has been created once and will never be replicated in any form or capacity ever again. It also comes with some needed discrestion from the listener. The mixtape as a whole has an extremely bass boosted and compressed mixed, with blaring synths and guitars at nearly every moment. This tape is unrelenting and each song is extremely loud and overblown, yet theres enough nuance that it doesn't get old or too much to handle if you can get past lyrics about murder, torture, dismemberment, and hell. Sematary is not afraid to get as explicit as possible, proudly stating his anger towards the alt-right, transphobes, nazis, and cops. There is an incredible amount of taste and skill needed to make a concept like this work in any capacity. A black metal, trap, witch house, noisecore fusion all placed in hell sounds ridiculous but it actually clicked with a suprisingly large amount of people and ended up an influential classic in underground rap. This would also be the last time Sematary and Ghost Mountain would collaborate until 2024.
