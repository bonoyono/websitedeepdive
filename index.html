    &quot;Grave House&quot; is a 12 track mixtape and is the first release of Sematary's discography. It is most notable for its grungy and washed out trap beats, deadpan vocals, esoteric lyricism, and its use of samples from black metal songs.

  <h3>Released 7th November 2019</h3>
  <p>
    &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; is an 11 track mixtape and is the second release of Sematary's Discography. It is most notable as Sematary's first mixtape to make an impact in the underground rap scene. This was in no small part from the iconic cover art. A bizarrely stretched photo of Sematary in his titular outfit of all black True Religion attire with New Rock boots is edited onto a surreal, liminal, bright green and blue landscape with a rainbow over a bridge. Sematary wished his dogs to be immortalized with this album hence the crudely pasted dogs on each side. Lila the black dog(left) passed away in October of 2024. Combining this with the oversaturated colors and deep fried filter over everything comes together to create a truly eye catching and potentially humorous album cover. As for the music, there is noticibly more focus in sound mixing, sample use, and vocal delivery. Several of Sematary's most famous songs are on this mixtape such as &quot;Slaughter House&quot; and &quot;Bunny Suit&quot;.

  <p>
    &quot;Warboy&quot; is a 6 track EP and is the third release of Sematary's discography. Easily the most underrated, dirtiest, grimiest sounding project he has produced. It is most notable for it's extremely washed out trap beats, hard black metal samples, and bizarre subject matter within the lyrics. Sematary has stated he was in a bad place when producing the EP which might explain why it has been seen as neglected by fans.
